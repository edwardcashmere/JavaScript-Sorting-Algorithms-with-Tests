# JavaScript-Sorting-Algorithms-with-Tests
This is a compilation of a few sorting Algorithms .
compilation of different sorting Algorithms
and tests using Jest for their viabilility.


# Slower Algorithms Time Complexity O(n^2) but the space complexity is O(1)
We have the slower algorithms selection sort,bubble sort and insertion sort typically all have quadratic  
runtimes when sorting data so as the dataset set increases the perfomance speed will suffer .



#Faster Sorting Algorithms
In this group we have but to Radix, Merge and quick sort but to name a few , their runtimes are better as compare to the previous three , they are well suited to handle large amounts of data .Their time complexity worst case scenario is O(n)  at best O(1)
